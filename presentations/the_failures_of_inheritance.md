# The Failures Of Inheritance

## Introduction

Inheritance provides a heirarchical structure and is designed to model the real world. The commonly used example is "Animals"

## Alternative

Composition providing a component that allows for saving and loading

Look into the testablilty

Dependency injection

Builder pattern/ Factory
