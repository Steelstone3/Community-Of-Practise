# Are Explicit Design Patterns Dead?

## Introduction

Consider the following quote for justification for explicit complex design patterns...

*"You can create a solution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice"* - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)

## Example

```cs
